### What is this? When was it created?
This artifact is a simple leaderboard written in PHP and HTML. The leaderboard pulls data from a database to satisfy the requirement for this portion of the final project. The project was created on March 30th, 2021.

### Why did I select this item? What specific components does this artifact showcase of my skills and abilities in software development? How was it improved?
This simple artifact is designed to demonstrate my ability to create a interaction that involves a database and a programming language such as PHP in this case. This item was selected primarily because I had written something similar when I was younger. This artifact was not necessarily improved as it was written for this assignment however, it was improved from the first time I wrote this code as it now contains simple annotations to explain the code.

### Did I meet the course objectives that were planned with the enhancements made to this artifact?
This artifact should meet the course objectives by its interaction of pulling data from a database and displaying it on a web page. There are no immediate plans to make further enhancements to this artifact however, if I were to add more complexity to this artifact I would start by adding a search feature and some styling using CSS.

### Challenges and Reflection
This artifact brought me back to the first time I wrote something like this, it was a fun trip down memory lane while also providing me the opportunity to improve upon it with my experience I have gained since I wrote it the first time. The goal of writing this artifact was to create a very simple yet effective version of a leaderboard which you might see at an arcade without any styling to make it as raw as possible to create a foundation for future iterations.
